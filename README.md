# online-cv
This repository is a demonstration on how to create a personal website for my CV.

# Purpose
My goal in this project was to modernize my CV in attempt to increase the exposure of my experiences through creating a dynamic website where I can display a running list of my past experiences that is viewable to anyone. 

Additionally, this project was an opportuntiy to further my skills by familiarizing myself with the process behind creating a personal website, as well as, establish a basic knowledge of the backend CSS & HTML code.

Lastly, in addition to having an online CV with personal background information, experience & skills, I wanted to include a section that would log different projects that I have completed to display my current skills with concrete examples that are open source.

## Initial Goals
- How to find free html templates to use for my personal website
- How to use Github Pages to host my website
- The role of html & CSS code in creating a website
- How to navigate & structure html code to add/modify the websites content
- How to change the css for formatting the websites presentation
- Where to find free images & How to apply them in the html index
- How to implement a working projects tab 

# Steps
Most of the steps that I followed to create this website were from a YouTube video from Joshua Fluke (reference linked below).
1. Create a folder named 'online-cv' where all code will be housed for my website.
    - I created this folder within my master GitHub folder because my site will eventually be hosted on GitHub Pages
2. Next, I must choose a template for my personal webiste.
    -  Using the site [html5up (https://html5up.net)] I can download a free html file that will provide a platform for me to build my website.
    - I chose to use the Dimension template for my site.
    - After choosing a template I can then modify the code to my exact specifications to create a site designed for what I want.
3. I download the Dimension template into the 'online-cv' folder that I initially created.
    - Within this download, contains a README.md file which is what this information page is written on
    - It contains an 'html_template' folder with the following sub folders:
        - It contains an assets folder which will contain CSS code which is used for aesthetical formatting of the website
        - It contains an images folder which will store any images that will be used for the website
        - Lastly, it contains an 'index.html' file which is where the html code that creates our template website is and this is where I edited the content of my website
4. Now, I edited the html code to change the content of the site to what I wanted it to be.
    - I changed the front page to display my name and the purpose of the website
    - I added an extra tab to the website and titled each of them with the following section names: About, CV, Skills, Projects, Contact
    - Within each section I added the relevant information:
        - The about section is used for personal background information about me essentially functioning as an introduction page
        - The CV section was then updated with my latest professional experience to date
        - The Skills section is a collection of different programming languages that I have familiarized myself with and different statistical techniques that I have used for each of the respective languages
        - The Projects folder is a collection of independent projects that I have completed showcasing some of my skills
        - Lastly, a Contact section which has yet to be made functional (except for the social media links which are connected)
5. Next, I added images for the background of the main page, as well as, some images for some of the sub sections.
    - All the images used for my site were taken from [Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)] which provides open-source free images
    - I had to download the relevant images that I wanted, searching by keyword on [Unsplash], and then adding them to the 'images' sub-folder within 'html_template'
    - Once they are added, you simply reference the file name of that image within the html code to get the image on your site
6. Next, the site has to be set up using GitHub as a hosting platform in order for it to go live.
    - A new repository has to be created on GitHub specifically for this website
    - In the end, the domain name of the website will have the follwing format: 'sitename.github.io' so whatever you want your 'sitename' to be should be the same as the new of the new repository you are creating
    - I created a new repository with the name 'jmulleavey.github.io'
    - Within the 'Quick Setup' box that should appear after creating the new repository, there should be a link to 'upload existing files'
    - This is where I uploaded the folder containing the READ.me & 'html_template' folder
        - The individual files themselves have to be uploaded one at a time
    - 'Commit Changes'

And that's it. After those steps I had a live personal website hosted through GitHub Pages. For any more detailed information on this process I recommended watching the referenced video below that I followed.
